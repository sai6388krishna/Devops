GREP
 "global regular expression print," processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern.
 
 syntax:
 
 grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
 
 grep "string" filename
 
 grep -l "string" filename -> displays only the file names 
 
 grep -i "string" filename -> case insensitive
 
 grep -c "string" filename -> counting the number of matches 
 
 grep -w "string" filename -> displays the exact line of that particular line 
 
 grep -w "string1\|string2" /filename  -> searches multiple words in that particular file 
 
 grep -w "^string" filename -> displays the line beginning with that string 
 
 grep -w "string$" filename -> displays the line ending with that string
 
 grep -n "string" filename -> displays the string with line number
 
 grep -v "string" filename -> displays all the lines except that line where the string is present
 
 grep -v ^$ filename -> diplays the file by removing all the empty lines
 
 grep -v ^# filename -> displays the file by removing the lines with # comments present in it
 
 grep -A "string" filename -> displays all the lines after that particular string 

 grep -A2 "string" filename -> displays 2 lines after that particular string
 
 grep -B2 "string" filename -> displays 2 lines before that particular string
 
 grep -C2 "string" filename -> displays 2 lines before and after that particular string 
 
 grep -r "string" directoryname -> displays all the lines in files in that directory with that particular string

egrep -i 'apple|banana|orange' *                                                      # same thing, case-insensitive
egrep 'score|nation|liberty|equal' gettysburg-address.txt                             # all lines matching multiple patterns
