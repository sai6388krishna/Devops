Logical Volume Management (LVM) on UBUNTU
change to root or use sudo before

Install lvm2 using 
$sudo apt-get install lvm2

Physical storage devices for LVM
pvcreate, pvscan, pvdisplay commands
By using the following commands we can use

we can create two volumes sda6 sda7
$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sda6 /dev/sda7

Two volumes will be created as
Physical volume "/dev/sda6" successfully created                                                 
Physical volume "/dev/sda7" successfully created 

We can view the physical volumes already created
$ sudo pvscan

To view the physical volumes with attributes like size, physical extent, total physical extent, free size, etc.
$ sudo pvdisplay

Create the volume groups
using commands vgcreate, vgdisplay

Eg: two volumes created sda6 and sda7 are combined as a volume group

we can be able to create a volume group using
$ sudo vgcreate vol_grp1 /dev/sda6 /dev/sda7
output: Volume  group "vol_grp1" successfully created

The following command displays lists of created volume groups
$ sudo vgdisplay

we can create logical volumes using the following
lvcreate, lvdisplay.

lvcreate will create a logical volume with a size of 80mb
$ sudo lvcreate -l 20 -n logical_vol1 vol_grp1 
Output: Logical volume "logical_vol1" created

use this lvdisplay command to view all the available logical volumes
$ sudo lvdisplay

we can use the created logical volumes
$ sudo  mkfs.ext3 /dev/vol_grp1/logical_vol1

LVM resize : to change the logical volume size or extend the volume size
$ sudo lvextend -L100 /dev/vol_grp1/logical_vol1

Output:1.Extending logical volume logical_vol1 to 100.00 MB 	 
       2.Logical volume logical_vol1 successfully resized

TO add additional size 
$ sudo lvextend -L+100 /dev/vol_grp1/logical_vol1 
Output: 1. Extending logical volume logical_vol1 to 200.00 MB 
        2. Logical volume logical_vol1 successfully resized
